I am a mathematician by training, with about a decade of research
experience in academia, where I specialized in the analysis of partial
differential equations.

I am interested in appyling machine learning techniques to computer
system security.  This site focuses on computers, networking, and
security, while ([fastai
companion](https://antoinechoffrut.github.io/fastai-companion/)) deals
with machine learning in general and neural nets in particular, with
the PyTorch and fastai libraries.
