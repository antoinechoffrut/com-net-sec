I am a mathematician by training, with a decade of research experience
in academia, where I specialized in the analysis of partial
differential equations.

I am interested in applications of machine learning techniques to
computer and information system security.  This site focuses on
computers, networking, and security, while [fastai
companion](https://antoinechoffrut.github.io/fastai-companion/) deals
with machine learning in general and neural nets in particular, as
well as the jPyTorch and fastai libraries.
